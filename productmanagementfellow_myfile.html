      <h1><b><font color="#2F334F">Product Management Fellow (My File NYC)</font></b></h1>
      <p class="lead">The City of New York is piloting a new open source digital tool, <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/opportunity/portfolio/my-file-nyc.page">My File NYC</a> that allows residents to store and share documents for social services. The pilot’s goals are to understand if a tool like this can be an effective way for residents to have better control of their personal information, reduce the time for establishing eligibility for benefits, and reduce the repetition of the document upload process each time residents apply for services. 
</p>
      <p class="lead">This is a paid four month fellowship with the potential to extend. Fellows will be coached and learn about product development in government, while contributing to work that impacts millions of New Yorkers. This Fellowship is being offered in collaboration with the Digital Impact and Governance Initiative at New America, our partners on My File NYC.
