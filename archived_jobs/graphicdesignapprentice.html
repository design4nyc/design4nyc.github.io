      <p class="lead">Apprenticeships are paid by the hour, part-time or full-time, with a minimum of three days per week.  Summer 2018 Apprenticeships will run from the beginning of June until the end of August. Projects will focus on the delivery, on-going success, and continuous improvement of government services.</p>
      <p class="lead">What previous apprentices have had to say:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"A Design Apprenticeship at NYC Opportunity offers a unique hands-on experience in social impact design. And by hands-on, I really mean it. You’ll be out on the field talking to New Yorkers, working directly with civic service leaders, and helping to solve real challenges with a diverse team—all through the lens of design."</p><footer>2017 Apprentice</footer>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"If you’ve ever wondered how you could apply your design expertise for social good, this is the place to learn and grow. I quickly gained valuable skills and truly felt like part of the team every step of the way. Ultimately the experience shaped how I view design and my own personal commitment to advancing social equality."</p><footer>2017 Apprentice</footer>
