      <h1><b><font color="#2F334F">Senior Research Associate</font></b></h1>
      <p class="lead">The Poverty Research Unit (PRU) of the Mayor’s Office for Economic Opportunity publishes the NYCgov poverty measure for New York City that is a nationally recognized metric for evaluating and targeting policies intended to reduce poverty. The <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/opportunity/poverty-in-nyc/poverty-measure.page">NYCgov poverty measure</a> has become an important tool for evaluating policies, assessing the progress the city has made over time in reducing poverty, and designing new policies to reduce current levels of economic deprivation. NYC Opportunity also releases an annual brief on the economic condition of immigrants in New York City, connecting economic outcomes to legal status.
  
      <p class="lead">We are seeking a Senior Research Associate to collaborate on annual production of the poverty report, conduct analysis of poverty data and join a team focused on policy initiatives to reduce poverty and inequality.</p>
