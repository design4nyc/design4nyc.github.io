      <p class="lead">The Designed by Community fellowship creates an opportunity to amplify the power and living expertise of residents who use or have used government services by equipping them with tools, resources, and a platform to design better public programs and services.</p>
      
      <p class="lead">The program provides fellows with a fundamental understanding of service design, government structures and levers for change, and rapid testing of ideas. Through workshops, hands-on learning, and professional mentorship fellows can expect to gain skills in facilitating community-led design processes to collaboratively design (co-design) public services that are inclusive and accessible with the people who use and deliver them.</p>
