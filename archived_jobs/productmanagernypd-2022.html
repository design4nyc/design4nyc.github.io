      <h1><b><font color="#2F334F">Product Manager - Ending the Poverty to Prison Pipeline</font></b></h1>
      <p class="lead">As part of a comprehensive effort to reform and reinvent New York City’s approach to criminal justice and policing, the City of New York is launching an “Ending the Poverty to Prison Pipeline” initiative that addresses the recommendations surfaced in the <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/home/downloads/pdf/reports/2021/Final-Policing-Report.pdf">Police Reform and Reinvention Collaborative draft plan</a>. Within this initiative, NYC Opportunity will be focused on developing solutions and furthering recommendations that connect low-income and justice-involved clients and their families to new or improved streamlined services and supports that center community needs, and prevent or reduce justice system contact.</p>
      <p class="lead">As part of the Ending the Poverty to Prison Pipeline initiative, the Product team will help improve access to the broad array of social services administered and funded by New York City.  This includes developing and managing digital tools that make it simpler to understand what services exist and easier for client-serving staff to make referrals and connections to complementary resources.  The Product Manager will be a key contributor to this work, collaborating with other members of our team whose expertise includes facilitating data integration to improve social service performance, facilitating better service experiences, and designing new digital and in-person services with agency partners.</p>
