      <h1><b><font color="#2F334F">UX/UI and Communications Designer</font></b></h1>
      <p class="lead">As part of a comprehensive effort to reform and reinvent New York City’s approach to criminal justice and policing, the City of New York is launching an “Ending the Poverty to Prison Pipeline” initiative that addresses the recommendations surfaced in the <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/home/downloads/pdf/reports/2021/Final-Policing-Report.pdf">Police Reform and Reinvention Collaborative draft plan</a>. Within this initiative, NYC Opportunity will be focused on developing solutions and furthering recommendations that connect low-income and justice-involved clients and their families to new or improved streamlined services and supports that center community needs, and prevent or reduce justice system contact.</p>

      <p class="lead">The Designer will support the Ending the Poverty to Prison Pipeline initiative, and use their expertise and experience to work collaboratively with multiple stakeholders to plan, research, produce potential prototypes, and create user flows and other designs relevant for the program.</p>
      <p class="lead">In addition to supporting the Ending the Poverty to Prison Pipeline initiative, this role will also provide ongoing support for other NYC Opportunity priorities. You will work closely with design, program and evaluation, data, product and technology team members to enhance and expand NYC Opportunity’s programs and products and will contribute to elevating, strengthening and executing the wider office’s strategies. This role will be part of the Service Design Studio team, but your work will be part of cross-collaborative efforts across the wider office, many of which will have touchpoints around the theme of improving and streamlining social service navigation.</p>
