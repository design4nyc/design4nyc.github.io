      <h1><b><font color="#2F334F">Senior Advisor, Connections to Care</font></b></h1>
      <p class="lead">
      The Division of Mental Hygiene of the <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/index.page">New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH)</a> is recruiting an Implementation and Improvement Research Associate for the Bureau of System Strengthening and Access (BSSA) in the Mental Health Innovation Lab (MHIL). MHIL evaluates, disseminates, and advises on the use of evidence-based best practices, provides hands-on support regarding use of implementation and improvement science to close treatment gaps, promote prevention, to support better data utilization. A major initiative of the MHIL is the <strong><a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/opportunity/portfolio/social-innovation-fund-sif.page">Connection to Care (C2C)</a></strong> program.
      <p class="lead">
       Connections to Care is a 5-year, $30M initiative testing a model of partnerships between 15 community based organizations (CBOs) paired with a licensed mental health provider (MHPs). Through this partnership, CBO staff receive ongoing training and coaching in a core set of mental health skills that are incorporated into daily programming at the CBO. These skills are used to promote the well-being and mental health of program participants and refer those in need of more in-depth clinical care to services at the MHP. Through C2C, DOHMH and its partners seek to advance the level of evidence through a third party evaluation.</p>
       <p class="lead">
       The Senior Advisor will oversee all aspects of the testing of the C2C model. This involves ensuring high-quality implementation of the model, managing data collection from the CBOs, providing strategic leadership for an overall technical assistance and learning network strategy, and ensuring data from implementation informs decision making and contributes to our understanding of the model as part of a 5-year evaluation of the model. This also includes researching and adapting tools to accurately assess and improve quality implementation and measure capacity of CBOs to tailor interventions to specific implementation contexts.</p>
