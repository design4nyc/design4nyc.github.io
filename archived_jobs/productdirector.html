      <h1><b><font color="#2F334F">Product Director</font></b></h1>
      <p class="lead">The Product Director turns ideas into digital services that can effectively address poverty-related challenges and expand opportunity for New Yorkers.</p>
      <p class="lead">As the leader of the Product team, you oversee the creation, delivery, measurement, and continuous improvement of NYC Opportunity’s <a href="http://www1.nyc.gov/site/opportunity/portfolio/products.page">growing portfolio of citywide digital tools</a>. The challenges faced by City residents are often complex and multi-faceted, cutting across the responsibilities of individual agencies. Our Office builds tools that help the City understand and serve residents more holistically. We also design and create public-facing applications to help residents access information, benefits and services more easily. The Product Director drives the strategy to extend these existing tools while also identifying, prioritizing and executing on additional product opportunities.</p>
      <p class="lead">The Product Director serves as a member of our Office’s interdisciplinary senior leadership team. Because NYC Opportunity works across City agencies, you are exposed to a broad range of issues faced by low-income New Yorkers, as well as the departments, programs, and resources that exist to provide a response. As technology and devices become more advanced and ubiquitous, solutions can be increasingly more personalized, analytical, adaptive, and scalable. Your role is to harness these possibilities and implement digital products that help the City address its residents’ most critical needs.</p>
      <p class="lead">The right leader will have a strong vision for how to translate New York City’s data and program assets into discrete digital tools; the operational savvy to guide high quality, citywide products; and, the acumen to work across agencies to help achieve policy goals.</p>
