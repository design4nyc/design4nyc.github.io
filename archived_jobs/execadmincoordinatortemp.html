      <h1><b><font color="#2F334F">Executive Administrative Coordinator (Temporary)</font></b></h1>
      <p class="lead">The Mayor’s Office for Economic Opportunity (NYC Opportunity) helps the City apply evidence and innovation to reduce poverty and increase equity.  We advance research, data and design in program and policy development, service delivery, and budget decisions. Our work includes analyzing existing anti-poverty approaches, developing new interventions, facilitating the sharing of data across City agencies, and rigorously assessing the impact of key initiatives. </p>
      <p class="lead">NYC Opportunity manages a discrete fund and works collaboratively with City agencies to design, test and oversee new programs and digital products. NYC Opportunity also produces research and analysis of poverty and social conditions, including its influential annual Poverty Measure, which provides a more accurate and comprehensive picture of poverty in New York City than the federal rate. Part of the Mayor’s Office of Operations, NYC Opportunity is active in supporting the de Blasio administration’s priority to make equity a core governing principle across all agencies.</p>
      <p class="lead">NYC Opportunity seeks a Temporary Executive Administrative Coordinator to support administration, office management, budget and expense tracking, contracting and procurement.</p>
