      <h1><b><font color="#2F334F">Designer</font></b></h1>
      <p class="lead"><a href="https://civicservicedesign.com/">The Service Design Studio</a> (the Studio) within the Mayor’s Office for Economic Opportunity (NYC Opportunity) uses service design to make City services effective and efficient as possible, ultimately enhance the lives of residents, particularly low-income residents across the City.</p>

      <p class="lead">One of the key responsibilities of this role is to support the development of a Human Resources Administration (HRA/DSS) Social Services Center (the Center), a dedicated innovation space for prototyping digital tools and improving in-center client experience through modernized business processes. Alongside senior-level service designers, you will work closely with internal and external stakeholders to develop a client-centered approach to creating and delivering new and improved innovations, as well as support the creation of any relevant prototypes for new or improved service tools, client flows or interactions. You will also support in the creation of visual assets to articulate the operational strategy for the Center.</p>

      <p class="lead">Additionally, you will work alongside the Studio team to contribute to the Studio’s two offerings: Designing for Opportunity projects and Capacity Building products. Designing for Opportunity projects are 6-12 month partnerships with City agencies to improve existing services with user input. Capacity Building  products are built by the Studio to teach City of New York employees the fundamentals of service design in order to improve systems, strategic processes, products and communications on an ongoing basis. These include refining or creating new Tools + Tactics resources, supporting our Office Hour program and supporting in the development or facilitation of workshops and agency convenings.</p>

      <p class="lead">We seek a designer who has demonstrated strengths in service design, visual communications and prototyping. Someone who shows a vested interest in applying their skills in the government setting and who is at a point in their career where they are looking to expand and apply their design experience in the civic space.</p>
