      <p class="lead">Interested in putting your data, policy, programming or analytic skills toward improving the lives of your fellow New Yorkers?</p>

      <p class="lead">TThe challenges faced by social service clients can cut across the purview of different City agencies. Many times, however, different agencies are unaware that they are working with the same clients. NYC Opportunity’s Enterprise Data Solutions (EDS) team attempts to break agency siloes through meaningful data sharing, integration, and analytic initiatives that help City agencies achieve better outcomes for individuals and families. We do this by identifying the core policy questions a new project is intended to solve, understanding the legal and technical challenges that need to be met, and building integrated data solutions that meet those requirements.</p>

      <p class="lead">Fellowships are intended to be hands-on, paid apprenticeships. Fellows must be able to commit to working for a minimum of 6 months, full or part time, with a minimum of three days per week. The fellowship is paid by the hour and will begin in early to mid-February.</p>
