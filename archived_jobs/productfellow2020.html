      <p class="lead">A product management fellowship or apprenticeship with our team is an opportunity to grow your expertise in product development and management, design, digital services, and public policy, and help improve the lives of millions of New Yorkers. Projects will focus on the delivery, on-going success, and continuous improvement of the City’s digital products and services.</p>
      
      <p class="lead">What previous apprentices have had to say:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"The City's digital products are a front door for New Yorkers. You could not ask for a better way to develop best practices in digital product management while contributing to equity and access through government."</p><footer>2018 Apprentice</footer>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"If you’ve ever wondered how you could apply your design expertise for social good, this is the place to learn and grow. I quickly gained valuable skills and truly felt like part of the team every step of the way. Ultimately the experience shaped how I view design and my own personal commitment to advancing social equality."</p><footer>2017 Apprentice</footer>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="lead">Fellowships and Apprenticeships are paid positions starting in the Spring of 2020 for three to five days per week. Apprenticeships are four-month commitments, with the potential to extend, and fellowships run for six months.</p>
      end through summer.</p>
