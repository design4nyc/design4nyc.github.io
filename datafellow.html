        <p class="lead">Within NYC Opportunity, the Enterprise Data Solutions team takes innovative approaches to linking data in a meaningful way, as a means to help inform decision making by City-wide stakeholder groups, including leadership, agencies, providers and clients. EDS views data as a protected asset that can be responsibly leveraged across digital products to support analytical initiatives, facilitate knowledge sharing, and develop policy strategy.</p>

        <p class="lead">The Data Fellow will support the development of content for our Metadata Catalog project. The NYC Opportunity’s new Metadata Catalog is a designed to be digital, searchable repository of information about data sets and systems that we curate, manage or share with City agencies, community-based organizations (CBOs) and the public. The catalog is intended to give researchers, analysts and developers detailed information about known sources of data including lineage, structure, formats, fields, appropriate uses and any governing legal requirements.</p>  

      <p class="lead">We are looking for for recent graduate students who have an interest in the library and archival sciences, information management and data science to become a fellow on our team. Fellowships are intended to be hands-on, paid fellowships. Fellows must be able to commit to working for a minimum of 9 months, full or part time, with a minimum of three days per week. </p>
