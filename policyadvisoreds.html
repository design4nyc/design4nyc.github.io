      <h1><b><font color="#2F334F">Policy Advisor</font></b></h1>
      <p class="lead">Within NYC Opportunity, the Enterprise Data Solutions team takes innovative approaches to integrate data across agencies to improve the delivery of social services, expand service outreach and inform public sector analytics and research. EDS views data as a valued asset that can be leveraged responsibly to increase equity and opportunity for all New Yorkers.</p>  

      <p class="lead">To do this work, we use proven strategies to responsibly bring together data. One of the ways we accomplish this is through Worker Connect, our flagship technology. Worker Connect provides access to administrative case data and documents from multiple New York City agencies through a single online portal. Caseworkers can search for clients and retrieve demographic information, household data, service interactions and casefile documents. Users of Worker Connect only access information that they have been authorized to view based on their role and all applicable laws and regulations.
