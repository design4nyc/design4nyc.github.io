      <h1><b><font color="#2F334F">Data Curator and Scientist - Ending the Poverty to Prison Pipeline</font></b></h1>

      <p class="lead">Within NYC Opportunity, the Enterprise Data Solutions team takes innovative approaches to linking data in a meaningful way, as a means to help inform decision making by City-wide stakeholder groups, including leadership, agencies, providers and clients. EDS views data as a protected asset that can be responsibly leveraged across digital products to support analytical initiatives, facilitate knowledge sharing, and develop policy strategy.</p>

      <p class="lead">As part of a comprehensive effort to reform and reinvent New York City’s approach to criminal justice and policing, the City of New York is launching an “Ending the Poverty to Prison Pipeline” initiative that addresses the recommendations surfaced in the <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/home/downloads/pdf/reports/2021/Final-Policing-Report.pdf">Police Reform and Reinvention Collaborative draft plan</a>. Within this initiative, NYC Opportunity will be focused on developing solutions and furthering recommendations that connect low-income and justice-involved clients and their families to new or improved streamlined services and supports that center community needs, and prevent or reduce justice system contact.</p>

      <p class="lead">To support this initiative, the Data Curator and Scientist will be responsible for understanding, documenting, and validating data from agency legacy systems to populate innovative new platforms. The ideal candidate will have experience working on large data projects, profile data and be able to develop clear documentation about the data for other analysts and end-users.</p>
