        <p class="lead">As part of the Mayor’s Office of Operations, the Accelerator/Connect unit is the City’s go-to resource for harnessing digital tools and capabilities to improve the lives of low-income and vulnerable New Yorkers, with the policy, management and technical expertise to help produce better outcomes for residents.</p>

<p>As part of this unit, the Innovation and Design Team works with policy teams, City agencies, community-based organizations, and end users to analyze needs and opportunities and turn them into actionable digital services than can be designed, prototyped, tested, and developed.</p>

          <div class="panel-body"><p>The unit currently operates HHS Accelerator, Worker Connect, and ACCESS NYC, and is actively working on new initiatives. Together, these initiatives break information silos through the use of modernized technology and coordinated agency practices to more efficiently and effectively provide health and human services to New Yorkers. The existing products provide a great opportunity for continuous iteration and interacting with a broad user base as we become more data-driven and user-centered. The Innovation and Design Team  is central to the work on all products and new iniatives by leading design and strategy, producing design materials, and working closely with the technology teams for development.</p><ul> 
<p><li><b><a href="http://www.nyc.gov/accessnyc">ACCESS NYC</a></b>, a website that allows New Yorkers to screen for eligibility for over 30 City, State, and Federal benefit programs. Depending on the benefit, residents can apply online, print out pre-populated application forms, and determine agency locations where they can go to directly apply for services.</p>
<p><li><b><a href="http://www.nyc.gov/hhsaccelerator">HHS Accelerator</a></b> is a transformational initiative to reengineer, simplify and speed the procurement process for City agencies and client and community based service organizations by implementing a series of policy reforms, restructuring of rules and regulations, centralizing portions of procurement oversights and building a web-based system to support these reforms to dramatically shift the City’s procurement of health and human services. 
<p><li><b><a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/hhsconnect/html/worker-connect/worker-connect.shtml">Worker Connect</a></b>, a data sharing technology that allows case workers to see real-time information about clients drawn from multiple City sources. Users only access information that they have been authorized to view based on their role and all applicable laws and regulations.
 
<p><li><b>New Initiatives</b> We are also working on new intiatives that build upon these products and our expertise areas, including reducing the burden on non-profits, facilitating data integration to improve social service performance, and easing access to services and programs.</ul>
