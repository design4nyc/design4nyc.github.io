Together, these initiatives break information silos through the use of modernized technology and coordinated agency practices to more efficiently and effectively provide health and human services to New Yorkers. The existing products provide a great opportunity for continuous iteration and interacting with a broad user base as we become more data-driven and user-centered. The Innovation and Design Team is central to the work on all products and new initiatives by leading design and user experience, producing design materials, conducting user research, working closely with the internal and vendor technology teams for development, and setting ongoing strategy for products.</p>

<p><li><b><a href="http://www.nyc.gov/accessnyc">ACCESS NYC</a></b>, a website that allows New Yorkers to screen for eligibility for over 30 City, State, and Federal benefit programs. Depending on the benefit, residents can apply online, print out pre-populated application forms, and determine agency locations where they can go to directly apply for services.</p></li>
<p><li><b><a href="http://www.nyc.gov/hhsaccelerator">HHS Accelerator</a></b> is a transformational initiative to reengineer, simplify and speed the procurement process for City agencies and client and community based service organizations by implementing a series of policy reforms, restructuring of rules and regulations, centralizing portions of procurement oversights and building a web-based system to support these reforms to dramatically shift the City’s procurement of health and human services. </li>
<p><li><b><a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/hhsconnect/html/worker-connect/worker-connect.shtml">Worker Connect</a></b>, a data sharing technology that allows case workers to see real-time information about clients drawn from multiple City sources.
