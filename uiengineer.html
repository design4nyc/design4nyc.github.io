      <h1><b><font color="#2F334F">User Interface (UI) Engineer</font></b></h1>
      <p class="lead">The City of New York is piloting a new open source digital tool, <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/opportunity/portfolio/my-file-nyc.page">My File NYC</a> that allows residents to store and share documents for social services. The pilot’s goals are to understand if a tool like this can be an effective way for residents to have better control of their personal information, reduce the time for establishing eligibility for benefits, and reduce the repetition of the document upload process each time residents apply for services. 
</p>
      <p class="lead">We are seeking a UI Engineer to help us iterate on the design and experience of the current product as we continue to pilot and learn from users. The UI Engineer will learn about product development in government, while contributing to work that impacts millions of New Yorkers.</p>
      <p class="lead"> <strong>This is a full-time, contract position for at least 6 months being offered in collaboration with the Digital Impact and Governance Initiative at New America, our partners on My File NYC.</strong></p>
