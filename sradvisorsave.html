      <h1><b><font color="#2F334F">Senior Advisor</font></b></h1>
      <p class="lead"></p>

      <p class="lead">The Senior Advisor will work with City agency partners to support and coordinate the design, implementation, program management, evaluation for multiple initiatives and projects. They will lead and manage a portfolio of programs, including the Save for College expansion, as well as a portfolio of new and existing initiatives, special projects, and evaluations across a range of issue areas affecting low-income New Yorkers, generated by NYC Opportunity and YMI. </p>

      <p class="lead">One key project that this position will work on relates to the <a href="https://nyckidsrise.org/save-for-college-program/">NYC Kids RISE Save for College Program</a>. Launched in 2018, the initiative is a scholarship and savings program designed to make college and career training more accessible for all NYC public school students— regardless of family income or immigration status. In partnership with <a href"https://nyckidsrise.org/">NYC Kids RISE</a>, every kindergarten student enrolled in a participating NYC public school automatically receives a NYC Scholarship Account with an initial $100 allocation on their behalf, unless their parents/guardians “opt out” of the program. The City will invest $15 million annually.</p>   

      <p class="lead">Additional programmatic areas of focus may include asset building, workforce development, education programs, health/behavioral health programs, out of school youth, and others.</p>
