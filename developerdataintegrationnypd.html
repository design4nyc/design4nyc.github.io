      <h1><b><font color="#2F334F">Developer, Data Integration - Ending the Poverty to Prison Pipeline</font></b></h1>

      <p class="lead">Within NYC Opportunity, the Enterprise Data Solutions team takes innovative approaches to integrate data across agencies to improve the delivery of social services, expand service outreach and inform public sector analytics and research.  EDS views data as a valued asset that can be leveraged responsibly to increase equity and opportunity for all New Yorkers.</p>

     <p class="lead">As part of a comprehensive effort to reform and reinvent New York City’s approach to criminal justice and policing, the City of New York is launching an “Ending the Poverty to Prison Pipeline” initiative that addresses the recommendations surfaced in the <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/home/downloads/pdf/reports/2021/Final-Policing-Report.pdf">Police Reform and Reinvention Collaborative draft plan</a>. Within this initiative, NYC Opportunity will be focused on developing solutions and furthering recommendations that connect low-income and justice-involved clients and their families to new or improved streamlined services and supports that center community needs, and prevent or reduce justice system contact.</p>

      <p class="lead">To support this initiative, the Developer will be part of the Integration Services of the EDS team, primarily responsible for providing timely and accurate data that enable data analytics and research that drive long-term policy and program development. Our back-end stack includes Oracle DB, AWS Cloud, IBM DataStage/QualityStage ETL and IBM Master Data Management (MDM).</p>
